# Messinia Graciene: Project DAHLIA

![Project DAHLIA banner](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnjaazvr7/image/upload/v1684522493/megura/dahlia-twitter_yae5go.png)

Dahlia is a state-of-the-art Discord bot that runs on chatGPT and supports both slash and text commands. As an all-rounder bot, she comes with a wide range of utilities, but her main purpose is to serve as a storyteller for a text-based RPG. Dahlia acts as an NPC (non-playable character) in the game, enabling players with supported NFT collections to communicate with her and participate in the game. With her advanced capabilities and cutting-edge technology, Dahlia offers an immersive and engaging experience for players looking to explore the world of text-based RPGs.
